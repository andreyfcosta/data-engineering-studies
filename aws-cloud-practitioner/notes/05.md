# Module 5 - Networking

## VPC - Virtual Private Cloud

an isolated private virtual network that defines **IP ranges**.

EC2, RDS, ECS **are inside a VPC**.

## **Subnet**

a **subdivision of the VPC** associated to a single **Availability Zone**

Example:

- VPC: `10.0.0.0/16`
- Subnet A (AZ-1): `10.0.1.0/24`
- Subnet B (AZ-2): `10.0.2.0/24`
    
    
    | Type | Characteristic |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Public subnet** | Has internet Access |
    | **Private subnet** | Does not directly access the internet |

An internet gateway is a connection between a VPC and the internet. 

AWS Direct Connect offers connectivity between **on-premises and AWS**. AWS PrivateLink can access services inside another VPC privately, with no internet exposition.

**Before a packet can enter or exit a subnet, it will run into a network Access Control List (ACL) associated with the subnet the packet is being routed to. The permissions defined by the network ACLs indicate what is allowed or denied.** 

Network ACLs → perform stateless packet filtering. They remember nothing.

Security groups → perform stateful packet filtering. They remember previous decisions made for incoming packets.

Security groups → **Control inbound and outbound traffic at the resource level**
