# 03 - Exploring Compute Services

### Lambda

Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers.

- Lambda handles execution, scaling, and resource allocation.

You can optimize performance by configuring the appropriate memory size for your function.

1. Upload code to Lambda
2. Code is triggered by a specific event
3. Code run when triggered

> "First, you’ll upload your container images to ECR, which is where your images get stored securely and are ready to be used. After that, you’ll pick an orchestration service based on what you need, either ECS or EKS. Lastly, you’ll choose your compute option, either EC2 or Fargate."

Amazon ECR: Amazon Elastic Container Registry

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a scalable container orchestration service for running and managing containers on AWS, like Docker containers. 

Docker is a software platform for building, testing, and deploying applications quickly.

Amazon EKS, or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. (*industry standard* for running containers created by Google)

**AWS Fargate is a serverless service**.

### Containers and VMs

A container packages your application with everything it needs to run, so it works the same on any computer. Containers are faster and lighter than virtual machines (VMs) because they share the host computer’s operating system.

**ECS/EKS are not the job — they are wqhere the job runs.**
