# 01 - Introduction to the Cloud

**Client-server model** → client makes a request and server validates it and deliver

**Cloud computing** → on demand delivery of IT resources (servers, storage solutions, databases, networking components, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools, and more.)

You can deploy cloud resources in multiple ways: **cloud, on-premises, hybrid**.

A company could start by using at least two *Availability Zones*, or AZs. They deploy the same configuration in each, and if one fails, they can failover to the other. This is called designing for **high availability and fault tolerance**.

 > AWS is responsible for security *of* the cloud, and customers are responsible for security *in* the cloud.
 
- AWS: hardware, data center, physical infrastructure.
- Client: data, perms, criptography, configurations.
