AWS has services, such as CloudFormation, that you can use to help automate the deployment of your cloud resources. These services use infrastructure as code, or IaC, helping you achieve a consistent, reliable set up each time your business grows.

Things to consider when choosing a Region/AZ:

1 - Compliance requirements to meet

2 - Proximity to users

3 - Features specific to that AZ

4 - Region-specific pricing

### CloudFormation

With CloudFormation, you can define your infrastructure as code (IaC). You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.
